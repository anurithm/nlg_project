# 🤖 Natural Language Generation (NLG) Text Generator

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **AI-based Natural Language Generation (NLG) system** that generates human-like text from user-provided prompts.  
It uses a **pre-trained Transformer model (GPT-2)** to produce meaningful and coherent text automatically.

The application is deployed as a **web app using Streamlit**, making it easy to interact with and demonstrate.
